                I have completed my graduation in computer science and engineering from the University of development
                alternative in 2020. My Final year
                project
                was
                “Disease detection using medical reports & suggesting expert doctors”, a fully dynamic website. I have
                used
                the
                Python Django framework for powering the backed operations.

                    I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything needed to make a website functioning
                    and
                    efficient. I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called
                    Vue
                    JS. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.

                    They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website
                    and
                    showed it to them. They liked it and uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming
                    Hero.
